Are you tired of refering to the bootstrap website to get the markup? Are you using PHP Storm? 

I have something that might interest you!

PHP Storm live templates based on Bootstrap 3.0.

## Installation

Simply clone the project anywhere on your computer and copy the files you need in the folder : 

`~/Library/Preferences/WebIdeXX/templates`

*`XX` depends on your version number.  For PHP Storm 8, the folder should be `WebIde80`*

## Contributing

Feel free to contribute to this repo so we can keep using up-to-date Bootstrap shortcuts!

All changes are made directly on the master branch.
